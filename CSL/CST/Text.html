    <h1>CSS Text</h1>
    <h2>Formatting Text with CSS</h2>
    <p>
      CSS provides several properties that allows you to define various text
      styles such as color, alignment, spacing, decoration, transformation, etc.
      very easily and effectively. The commonly used text properties are:
      text-align, text-decoration, text-transform, text-indent, line-height,
      letter-spacing, word-spacing, and more. These properties give you precise
      control over the visual appearance of the characters, words, spaces, and
      so on. Let's see how to set these text properties for an element in more
      detail.
    </p>
    <h1>Text Color</h1>
    <p>
      The color of the text is defined by the CSS color property. The style rule
      in the following example will define the default text color for the page
      body { color: #434343; } Although, the color property seems like it would
      be a part of the CSS text, but it is actually a standalone property in
      CSS. See the tutorial on CSS color to learn more about the color property.
    </p>
    <h1>Text Alignment</h1>
    <p>
      The text-align property is used to set the horizontal alignment of the
      text. Text can be aligned in four ways: to the left, right, centre or
      justified (straight left and right margins). Let's take a look at an
      example to understand how this property basically works. h1 { text-align:
      center; } p { text-align: justify; }
    </p>
    <h1>Text Decoration</h1>
    <p>
      The text-decoration property is used to set or remove decorations from
      text. This property typically accepts one of the following values:
      underline, overline, line-through, and none. You should avoid underline
      text that is not a link, as it might confuse the visitor. Let's try out
      the following example to understand how it basically works: h1 {
      text-decoration: overline; } h2 { text-decoration: line-through; } h3 {
      text-decoration: underline; }
    </p>
    <h2>Removing the Default Underline from Links</h2>
    <p>
      The text-decoration property is extensively used to remove the default
      underline from the HTML hyperlinks. You can further provide some other
      visual cues to make it stand out from the normal text, for example, using
      dotted border instead of solid underline. Let's take a look at the
      following example to understand how it basically works: a {
      text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px dotted; }
    </p>
