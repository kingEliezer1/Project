    <h1><em>Universal Selector</em></h1>
    <p>
      The <em>universal selector,</em> denoted by an asterisk (*), matches every
      single element on the page. The universal selector may be omitted if other
      conditions exist on the element. This selector is often used to remove the
      default margins and paddings from the elements for quick testing purpose.
      Let's try out the following example to understand how it basically works:
    </p>
    <div id="T">
      Inline styles are used to apply the unique style rules to an element by
      putting the CSS rules directly into the start tag. It can be attached to
      an element using the style attribute. The style attribute includes a
      series of CSS property and value pairs. Each "property: value" pair is
      separated by a semicolon (;), just as you would write into an embedded or
      external style sheets. But it needs to be all in one line i.e. no line
      break after the semicolon, as shown here
    </div>
    <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
    <p>
      A CSS selector is a pattern to match the elements on a web page. The style
      rules associated with that selector will be applied to the elements that
      match the selector pattern. Selectors are one of the most important
      aspects of CSS as they allow you to target specific elements on your web
      page in various ways so that they can be styled. Several types of
      selectors are available in CSS, let's take a closer look at them:
    </p>
    <ul class="menu">
      <a>An Element type selector</a>
      matches all instance of the element in the document with the corresponding
      <li>
        element type name. Let's try out an example to see how it actually
        works: p { color: blue; }
      </li>
      The style rules inside the p selector will be applied on every element (or
      paragraph) in the document and color it blue, regardless of their position
      in the document tree
    </ul>
    <p>
      Adjacent Sibling Selectors The adjacent sibling selectors can be used to
      select sibling elements (i.e. elements at the same level). This selector
      has the syntax like: E1 + E2, where E2 is the target of the selector. The
      selector h1 + p in the following example will select the p elements only
      <li>
        if both the h1 and p elements share the same parent in the document tree
        and h1 is immediately precedes the p element. That means only those
      </li>
      paragraphs that come immediately after each h1 heading will have the
      associated style rules. Let's see how this selector actually works
    </p>
