    <h2>Styling Fonts with CSS</h2>
    <p>
      Choosing the right font and style is very crucial for the readability of
      text on a page. CSS provide several properties for styling the font of the
      text, including changing their face, controlling their size and boldness,
      managing variant, and so on. The font properties are:
      <em>font-family,</em> <em>font-style,</em> <em>font-weight,</em>
      <em>font-size,</em> and <em>font-variant.</em> Let's discuss each of these
      font properties one by one in more detail.
    </p>
    <h1>Font Family</h1>
    <p>
      The font-family property is used to specify the font to be used to render
      the text. This property can hold several comma-separated font names as a
      fallback system, so that if the first font is not available on the user's
      system, browser tries to use the second one, and so on. Hence, list the
      font that you want first, then any fonts that might fill in for the first
      if it is not available. You should end the list with a generic font family
      which are five â€” serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive and fantasy. A
      typical font family declaration might look like this: body { font-family:
      Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; }
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common font families used in web design are serif and sans-serif,
      because they are more suitable for reading. While monospace fonts are
      commonly used to display code, because in this typeface each letter takes
      up the same space which looks like typewritten text. The cursive fonts
      look like cursive writing or handwriting. The fantasy font represents
      artistic font, but they're not used widely because of poor availability
      across the operating systems.
    </p>
    <h2>Difference Between Serif and Sans-serif Fonts</h2>
    Serif fonts have small line or stroke at the extremities of characters,
    whereas sans-serif fonts are straighter and do not have these small strokes.
    See the following illustration
    <img src="/Images/tt.jpg" alt="Text Images" />

    <p class="normal">
      Font Style The font-style property is used to set the font face style for
      the text content of an element. The font style can be normal, italic or
      oblique. The default value is normal. Let's try out the following example
      to understand how it basically works: p.normal { font-style : normal; }
      p.italic { font-style : italic; } p.oblique { font-style : oblique; }
    </p>
